# Analyzing Commodity Price Trends and Predictive Modeling

*Project Description:*

I undertook this project to analyze historical commodity price trends and develop predictive models to forecast future prices, focusing specifically on Gold. Using Python, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using the ARIMA method. My goal was to derive actionable insights that could assist in decision-making processes within the energy and commodities trading sector.

*Methodology:*

For this project, I began by collecting and cleaning a dataset that spans from 2000 to March 2022, encompassing daily prices for various commodities, including Gold. The dataset included columns such as Commodity, Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. I handled missing values through forward filling to ensure the dataset's integrity for analysis.

The next step was exploratory data analysis (EDA), where I visualized price trends over time to identify patterns and anomalies. I calculated 50-day and 200-day moving averages to highlight short-term and long-term trends. These moving averages were crucial for understanding the overall movement of commodity prices and identifying potential buy/sell signals.

Feature engineering involved computing these moving averages, which provided a clearer view of the trends and smoothed out short-term fluctuations. This was followed by predictive modeling using the ARIMA model. I split the data into training and testing sets, applied the ARIMA model, and evaluated its performance using the Mean Squared Error (MSE). I extended the predictions to 60 days into the future to showcase the model's forecasting capabilities.

*Analysis and Implications:*

The historical data visualization for Gold revealed a consistent upward trend with periodic fluctuations. This pattern underscored Gold's role as a safe-haven asset, especially during economic uncertainties. The moving averages provided further insights into short-term and long-term price movements. Crossovers between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages often indicated potential buy and sell signals, which are valuable for trading strategies.

The ARIMA model's predictions for Gold prices demonstrated reasonable accuracy for short-term forecasting. The future price predictions indicated possible upward and downward trends, which could help stakeholders make informed decisions. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the test set was within an acceptable range, validating the model's reliability.

*Critical Evaluation:*

One of the strengths of this project is the comprehensive approach to handling time series data, performing advanced data analysis, and applying predictive modeling techniques. The moving averages and ARIMA model provided actionable insights that could be directly applied to trading strategies. The visualizations effectively communicated complex data trends and predictions.

However, there are limitations. The ARIMA model, while useful for short-term predictions, may not capture long-term market dynamics and external factors influencing commodity prices. The analysis was based solely on historical price data and did not consider macroeconomic indicators, geopolitical events, or market sentiment, which could impact accuracy.

*How to Run the Project:*
To replicate this project, ensure that Python and the necessary libraries are installed. Download the commodity.csv dataset and place it in the same directory as the script. Running the script will perform the analysis and generate the visualizations.
